#### From Our Coaches and Mentors 

>"David is one of the most technical guys in the sport and has a unique, unorthodox game. He is always working to help others get better, no matter where he trains. He has developed a successful school, Austin Jiu-Jitsu. He is always developing new moves and shares them with others through his school and his web sites. His impact on the sport goes beyond Texas. " <cite>Professor Travis Tooke, Houston, TX</cite>

>David has dedicated himself to continuously learning more about this sport. By building his own school he has also focused on different ways to teach and develop his own students. His promotion is overdue."

#### From Other Coaches

"Your humility and overall demeanor reflect as good for the sport. In my fleeting 20 years teaching martial arts I've really been put off by the political nature that so often typifies things. Jiu-jitsu's rise in popularity has only spiked this trend. I believe you bring a countervailing dignity and 'purist' sort of enthusiasm." Jason Webster, CTC Thai Boxing and MMA Coach

"Your black belt was well deserved. You put the blood, sweat, and tears in and you got it. Congratulations, you certainly earned it." Rodney Solis, CTC Head Trainer and Manager

"Congratulations on winning the 1st place team trophy!" The late Master Carlson Gracie, 9th Degree Red and Black Belt, Chicago, IL "Your skill and fastidious, technical attention to detail are first-rate." Kickboxing and Thai Boxing coach Jason Webster, Austin, TXOn Dave's Brown Belt promotion: "Man, you deserve it. You've got the skills and certainly put in the time (4+ years as purple)" BJJ Purple Belt D. Miller, San Marcos, TX"You are the only person that I know of in the entire city of Austin who is not only a good hearted person but also good to our younger generation." E. Peralez, BJJ Brown belt"You are a good referee. Good job!" Rodrigo "Comprido" Medeiros, 3rd Degree Black Belt, on David's coaching at the Carlson Gracie Open

"I really enjoy your videos and wanted to let you know that your effort do not go unappreciated! It is people like yourself that help better the understanding of the martial arts and its beauty." - JC, Shotokan Black Belt, Los Angeles, CA

"I see the same love for teaching in you that I have when I work with my baseball guys. What I've learned so far in jits has been very traditional and I see that you study the evolution of the sport, which means there's a lifetime more I can learn and I'm really looking forward to getting back in the game." - BH, Sports Trainer, Austin, TX

#### From Students

"I have so much confidence in your training techniques and teaching. People have been commenting on my technique and style, all thanks to you.." - IG, Boston, MA

"I am quite happy that I joined, and have found the classes to be fantastic." - DB, Austin, TX

"I'm impressed with coach David Thomas. This means much more than how well someone fights.  There are a LOT of fantastic fighters out there who aren't good people.  For me to be impressed with someone, it takes into account not just their skill and knowledge, but attitude, willingness to help others, their character, and their integrity." - JD, Austin, TX

"Technique, training, and technology - all top notch." - DF, Austin, TX

"I am enjoying myself and all the people associated with your school. This has really been a huge challenge for me--I appreciate your help and encouragement. Thanks, Coach!" - BM, Austin, TX

"Our instructor was so great with his words for each of us, praising our individual talents!" - TG, San Antonio, TX

"...as an instructor, coach, and mentor in BJJ, and in life he is top notch!! Always very open, gives great feedback, and pulls no punches."

"Thanks for being a man, instructor, and person I'm proud to stand behind.  I think it was Alex that hit it last night when he recognized you as our father. Thanks, El Conquistador!" - TG, San Antonio, TX

"I will stay training with David because he supports my goals to compete nationally and hopefully in Brazil one day too. He also respects me and treats me no different than his male students. He will challenge me but also guide and support me in working toward my goals. There are no politics or drama in his school it's about bjj. I also believe in his personal training philosophy."

"You really helped me with my match by coaching me through it. Thanks."

"my growth as a martial artist and competitor will be due to David Thomas' guidance and support that meets and exceeds my desire to learn with his desire to share his art."

"[After my injury] David's guidance and skill as a higher ranking belt to listen, support, and roll with me with the knowledge of my injury was invaluable to me - it gave me mat time when I was overcoming fear and anxiety about rolling but determined to do it anyway. It is what I needed to build my confidence again."

"I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have David as an instructor."

"I feel extremely privileged to be training with you. Thanks for being my instructor. I get to train better than before, and got to fall in love with BJJ all over again. Thank you for giving it back to me."

"There aren't adequate words to express how proud I am of David as an instructor, a man, a husband, a father, and especially for me - as a friend. I often tell people I pay attention to what others choose to do, or not do, not just what they say - it's about character and how they choose to conduct themselves. No doubt about it, David is a man of strong character and is a doer in life and he feels compelled to teach his art." TG

"[I am] honored to grace his mats."

"I am eternally grateful for David's support as he helps me in following my dreams."

"Thank you for listening, encouraging and leading.  You rock!"

"I like rolling with you because you know what a challenge it is to fight and win against larger opponents. You let me work technique without just beating up on me and I feel like I learn. Other instructors don't do that. "

"Thanks for another great class. I really enjoy the workout and challenge!" - DF

"I'm enjoying the experience and you've definitely got me hooked on Jiu-Jitsu." - JL

"I want to let you know that I appreciate the great learning environment and your instruction. I'm in better shape, more confident, and less stressed."

"Training with you has been a very positive influence on my life!" - BAM, Pittsburgh, PA

From Past Students and Private Instruction Students

"Utilizing what you taught me in our private lesson I tapped a BJJ fighter with 3 years more experience than me 4 times! It was glorious. That underhook in sideguard is amazing, along with the foot control you showed me. Passed his guard every time by controlling the feet! ." - Matt S.

"I cannot express how much I've enjoyed grappling and learning from you over the last few years. Your school and the attitudes that permeate it are a credit to your passion for the sport and those who want to learn. Thank you for that." - WG

"You and jiu-jitsu have really made a significant impact on me. I used to avoid confrontations at all costs. After rolling with you guys, I gained a whole new perspective on how to handle a potential confrontation/opponent. A switch came on and confrontations became a game with strategies and opportunities. That perspective has really made me a better person. Once you mentioned that taking initiative on things that weren't even your responsibility had provided you with great opportunities. Believe it or not, that conversation really hit home. Some amazing things have happened because of that advice. Simple lessons with great results. Thanks Dave!" JL, Austin, TX

"I can't imagine training with anyone better than you Dave - I really can't - you're an amazing teacher, trainer, friend, coach and have made my training a phenomenal growth experience for me, it's been invaluable to me."

"I always enjoyed you as a teacher." - CR

"I always liked your method of instruction. I think about it a lot and I miss it." - CS

"David motivates teams, solves problems, and [he has] an appreciation and understanding of what motivates people: trust, respect, honesty, and high expectations. He has a keen intellect, aggressive problem solving, and a cut-through-the-B.S. attitude that identifies problems and communicates clearly what needs to be done. He promotes mentoring and advancement, and is also so concerned about the "whole person." I particularly want to laud this person's communication skills. His warmth, humor and genuine openness are really refreshing."

"Thank you for taking the time to work with me. You possess an understanding, and openness with your knowledge that is rare and refreshing.
It was honor to train with you. I hope to learn from you again in the future." AL, NYC

"I liked the way the class was structured, real good vibe." - ES

"I would like to thank you for all of your instruction at Austin Jiu Jitsu. I learned a great deal about the art of grappling and enjoyed furthering my skills in a competitive environment. I would definitely recommend your gym to any of my friends interested in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu."  -JN UT, Austin
