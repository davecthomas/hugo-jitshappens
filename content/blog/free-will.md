#### Student Migration and the Search for Personal Growth

_Treating students as the property of a school or coach demonstrates a lack of understanding of free will._

People who train in any sport or martial art are free agents. They should continue to move from training gym to gym until they find a place that suits their needs. Their needs will change over time as they make decisions about what they need to develop, and as they gain skills. Their free will to learn and grow is the driving force behind migration of students across various schools over time. In any given city, you will find numerous students who have trained with a handful of different coaches. Over time, they change coaches because one coach may offer stronger training in an aspect that the student needs more work in. There is no such thing as "stealing students." Coaches are in business to grow students and develop their school. Students are involved to find personal growth. Coaches are in competition for students. As student select to change schools, coaches often incorrectly think that their student has been stolen as if the student was the property of the instructor. Treating students as the property of a school or coach is an unfortunate viewpoint that demonstrates a lack of understanding of free will in human beings.

Coaches: It's about the students not about you.
Students: if they don't get it, find a new coach.
