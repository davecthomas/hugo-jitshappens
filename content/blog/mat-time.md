"It's all about mat time." When I was a white belt, I was always working on passing the guard, my side control, defending the guard pass, and in general how to hold down bigger guys. I have always focused on control first: position before submission. Get in here and train as often as you can, and you will get results.

Here’s a quote from an interview with Marcelo Garcia when asked for recommendations on how to improve in Jiu-Jitsu.

>"I can tell you the things that I did when I was a blue belt, or a white belt. I spend the most time that I had in the school. I would think twenty-four hours a day about Jiu-Jitsu. Since I was a white belt I felt like I wanted to do this with my life. And I hope I do this forever. But don’t try to find different stuff. Don’t try too much to find secrets.
The only thing people have to do to be good in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is train in Jiu-Jitsu. Spend all of your time doing Jiu-Jitsu."
